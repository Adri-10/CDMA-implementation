# WIRELESS-NETWORKING
CDMA (Code-Division Multiple Access) is a spread spectrum multiplexing technique.
In second-generation (2G) and third generation (3G) wireless communications, it refers to any of several protocols. 
As the name suggests, CDMA is a type of multiplexing that enables several signals to share a single transmission channel, making the best use of the available bandwidth.
Implement CDMA
Scenario details: 8 senders and their corresponding receivers and you need to generate orthogonal code for each of them.
Input : bit string of size 8 depicting input of each user at that time slot
Output: data string in the medium and output bit string of size 8 depicting the output of each of the users.
